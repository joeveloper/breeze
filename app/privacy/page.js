                                        Aermint trading algorithm is integrated into the largest personal finance management
                                        platforms, including Binance, Poloniex, Bittrex, etc. In the span of milliseconds,
                                        Aermint makes bids and asks on the platforms, then selects and suggests the best
                                        available rate and displays the estimated rate on our site. The rates remain
                                        approximate until the transaction is actually made on the blockchain, which is why
                                        the exchange rate at the time of a transaction may differ slightly from the
                                        estimated rate that you see when you begin a transaction. To learn more about the

                                    <p>Aermint mobile app does! Mobile app users will no longer be affected by the risks
                                        associated with cash market fluctuations. Soon, the fixed-rate exchanges will also
                                        be implemented on the web version. To lock the current exchange rate, the user needs
                                        to click on the lock icon, which will result in them getting the exact same amount
                                        of cash as is displayed on the screen. The rate is fixed for 15 minutes, which
                                        should be more than enough to carry out the exchange.

                                    <p> Alternatively, Aermint offers our lowest fee of 0.25% for all cash-to-cash
